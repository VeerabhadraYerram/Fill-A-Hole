// This is a placeholder for Firebase initialization. 
// In a real app, this would import 'firebase/app' and 'firebase/firestore'
// and initialize your Firebase project. 
// Since we are writing pure JS services, we will accept `db` (Firestore instance) 
// as an argument to our service functions to allow for easy mocking and dependency injection.

export const db = {}; // Represents the Firestore instance
